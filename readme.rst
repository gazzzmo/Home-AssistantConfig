Home Assistant
==============

This is my configuration for Home Assistant.

Home Assistant is a home automation platform running on Python 3. It is able to track and control all devices at home and offer a platform for automating control.

To get started:

.. code:: bash

    python3 -m pip install homeassistant
    hass --open-ui

Check out `home-assistant.io <https://home-assistant.io>`__ for `a
demo <https://home-assistant.io/demo/>`__, `installation instructions <https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/>`__,
`tutorials <https://home-assistant.io/getting-started/automation-2/>`__ and `documentation <https://home-assistant.io/docs/>`__.

The system is built using a modular approach so support for other devices or actions can be implemented easily. See also the `section on architecture <https://home-assistant.io/developers/architecture/>`__ and the `section on creating your own
components <https://home-assistant.io/developers/creating_components/>`__.

If you run into issues while using Home Assistant or during development
of a component, check the `Home Assistant help section <https://home-assistant.io/help/>`__ of the website for further help and information.
